# Rules

{% include ad-skyscraper.html %}

All you need is a standard deck of cards, and a makeshift counter of some sort for each player.

## Setup

Find a space on the ground or a table. Take your pack of cards, remove the aces and place them to one side. For 2 player games deal 6 cards to each player, for 3 players deal four cards, and 4 players deal 3 cards.

Lay out the remaining cards face down in a 6 by 6 rectangle. This rectangle represents *the high seas*. There are four *islands* on the sea, represented at by the four Aces. Place each of these face up on each corner of the rectangle, one in from the edge, like this:

Place each player's counter on one island of the sea - this represents their *ship*. In two player games put the players on diagonally opposite islands.

## Aim

The player who scores the most points in hand wins at the game end. Points are gained through recruiting first mates, meeting island governors and finding treasure.

## Gameplay

Decide who starts by mutual consent. Play continues clockwise in turns. During a turn a player may choose to either *sail* or *drift*.

### Sail

To sail away from an island on the first turn, choose any crew card (number card) from your hand. Show the rest of the players that card and return it to your hand.

This gives you as many *sailing points* to sail that turn as the number on the card. You don't have to use all your points, but any extra points are wasted.

It costs 3 sailing points to sail to an adjacent square, and 5 points to sail diagonally.

You may only change direction once during your turn, you cannot sail into the same square twice in the same turn and you cannot finish on the square you started on.

#### Sailing on the sea

In subsequent turns, in order to sail from any sea square, place the chosen crew card face up on the square your ship is on before moving.

#### Storms

If you sail to a square without any card on it, you have sailed into a fearful storm: you must end your turn there and place a crew card face up to represent crew lost during the squall.

#### "Heave to!"

When coming to rest on a sea square, pick up any cards on that square and add them to your hand.

If you choose to sail onto an island space, you must end your turn there. Pick up any cards underneath the ace (but not the ace itself.)

Cards in a players hand have different uses. The number cards represent *crew* and can be used to sail the ship and to fight battles. The Jack and Queen cards are new *first mates* you've recruited - they have a treasure map you can used to recover treasure on an island. The Kings represent *island governors* - you can sail them back to their island for a reward. The aces represent *treasure*.

If you have landed on another player ship, resolve combat. After this, your turn is over, and play passes to the left.

#### Discovering treasure

If, when landing on an island, you have a face card in your hand of the same suit as an ace on the island you have landed on, you may exchance the face card with the ace and place the ace in your hand. This represents digging for treasure if you use a Jack or Queen or receiving a governor's reward if you use a King.

No further exchanges are permitted at an island once the treasure has been discovered.

### Drifting

If you have no crew cards, you have the option of drifting one square without having to place a card. Resolve the rest of your turn in the same way as for *sailing* above.

## Combat

To attack another ship, sail onto the sea square it occupies. Ships on islands are immune from attack - you can sail onto the same island square, but combat is not resolved. If you sail to a square with more than one ship, you choose which ship you attack.

To attack, pick a crew card from your hand and place it face down in front of you. The defender does the same, and both cards are revealed together. The player with the highest card is a winner. If you don't have a card to place as a defender, you can choose not to place a card.

The cards used for combat are lost: they are placed face up on the island which matches their suits underneath the face up card on top. The winner then gets to select one card at random from the loser's hand. If there is a draw, first the attacker selects a card from the defenders hand and then the defender selects a card from the attackers hand (not including the card the attacker just drew).

## Game end

The game ends when all treasure has been reclaimed (all aces are replaced by face cards.) As soon as the last treasure is found, all the hands are shown face up. The person with the highest scoring cards is the winner.

The cards are worth the following points at game end:

- Ace: 3
- King: 2
- Queen: 1
- Jack: 1
- Crew cards: 0

If there is a tie, the person with the most aces wins, followed by the most kings, etc.

## Variant: Hidden cards

When placing cards to sail, and resolving combat, show the cards to the other players, but then place the crew cards face down instead of up on the board. This makes for a much tougher game on the memory.
