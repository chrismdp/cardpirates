I'm still considering whether the drift rules work correctly or not. Thematically, drifting fits - you don't have enough crew to man the boat, or your boat is too weighed down with treasure, special cards or landlubbers to sail properly.

In a three player game you only start with a few crew cards: in a four player game you have even less, which means that you are constantly fighting for crew as soon as you get a bit of treasure. Burying treasure "lightens the boat", which should make drifting in light winds with half a crew much easier.

To this end, I've relaxed the drifting rules: you can **now drift if you have three cards or less** rather than two cards or less. That means in four player games you can drift from turn one if you need to. That in turn will mean that more storms will spring up, making the map more chaotic and congested with more players. I've yet to test this, but I think that'll just add to the fun!
