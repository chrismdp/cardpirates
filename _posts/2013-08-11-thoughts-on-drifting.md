I'm still considering whether the drift rules work correctly or not. Thematically, drifting fits - you don't have enough crew to man the boat. In a three player game you only start with a few crew cards: in a four player game you have even less, which means that you are constantly fighting for crew as soon as you get a bit of treasure. My strategy above doesn't quite fit thematically - burying treasure "lightens the boat", which should make sailing easier. Perhaps drifting isn't the word: perhaps you're 'rowing' instead. Thoughts welcome!
