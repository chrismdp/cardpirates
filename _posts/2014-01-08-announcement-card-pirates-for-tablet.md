Exciting news: today my friend [Richard Patching](http://twitter.com/disciplex) and I started working on Card Pirates the video game!

I've been looking for an excuse to work with Richard for ages, and I'm really excited about collaborating on this project with him. We're planning to blog on development progress over the next few weeks. Richard is going to be taking charge of the development, and I'm going to take the lead on the design and business side of things. We've already managed to get some concept art for how the game will look: we'll be talking more about that soon. Card Pirates will start out on mobile devices: we're initially going to build it for iOS (iPhones and iPads) with a view to making an Android version soon after.
