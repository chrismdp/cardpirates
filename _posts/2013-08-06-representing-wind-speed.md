When playtesting the game, we are always looking for thematic story like events that we can use to tell the story of the game. Last night we had a situation looking a little like this:

![Trying to get to Club Island - which way to go?](/assets/blog-representing-wind.png)

I needed to get to Club Island in a couple of turns. It's interesting that I found myself saying: "I'll take the North West route around that storm that's due West, as the wind looks better there."

What I meant was this: I was planning to get to the 8 of clubs at *1* north east of me in my first turn. I could then guarantee to get to Club Island on the second turn, as I could then use the 8 to move straight there. If I went South West, I might not get the card I needed at to *2* or *3*.

Of course, I could go through the storm at *4*, but then I'd have to place down an extra card to move there, which I could ill afford at the time.

It's fun that upturned cards in the sea, left by others as they travel through, effectively represent known good/bad sailing conditions as you pass through, which is a lot like wind speed, and weather.
