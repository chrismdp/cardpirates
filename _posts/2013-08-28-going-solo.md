My nine-year old son is I think determined to break his own all-time Card Pirates playing record. He can't seem to either stop playing, or when he's not playing, asking for another game! We made these [Solo Play](/rules#variant-solo-play) variant rules specifically for him!

The game plays as normal, with some simple exceptions: you get all 12 of the extra cards at the beginning of the game, but each time you sail or drift you must discard an extra card from your hand. The discarded card is put to one side, plays no further part in the game, and is not counted for scoring. The game is over as normal, or when you can no longer move or wish to move. You then count up your score to see how you did!

What do you think? More importantly: can you beat a score of 16?
