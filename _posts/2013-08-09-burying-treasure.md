We played with the Burying treasure variant last night: it was so fun that I immediately decided it had to be part of the main rules. It's not that complicated and adds some interesting strategic options.

My motivation in burying my treasure was that I had a lot of face cards and two Aces, and only one crew card. Therefore I needed to cut my card count down in order to be able to drift, and not have to place a crew card, thereby building up a crew for an attack. However, I left my treasure too close to my daughter's ship: she promptly dig the lot up. I attacked her immediately, but was very unlucky and managed to draw two '2' cards from her hand. She went on to win with 9 points to my 1. Ouch :)

I'm still considering whether the drift rules work correctly or not. Thematically, drifting fits - you don't have enough crew to man the boat. In a three player game you only start with a few crew cards: in a four player game you have even less, which means that you are constantly fighting for crew as soon as you get a bit of treasure. My strategy above doesn't quite fit thematically - burying treasure "lightens the boat", which should make sailing easier. Perhaps drifting isn't the word: perhaps you're 'rowing' instead. Thoughts welcome!
