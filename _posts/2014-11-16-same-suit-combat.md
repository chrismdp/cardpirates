I've been playing some games with my (now) 8yo daughter, and trialling some extra rules which work particularly well for Card Pirates 2.0. Here's the second one:

## Same suit combat

When attacking and defending, *all* combat cards a player plays must be of the same suit. The defender does not have to follow the attacker's suit, but must still play only cards of any one suit when defending.

This works particularly well with advanced sailing, which I'm thinking of making the default rule at the moment now card come more plentifully. It forces the player into agonising choices about keeping a sole 10 card, or using it to sail to a particular island, or catch up with their quarry. Assembling a killer combat crew becomes that much harder and more skillfull.

What do you think?
