I've just been away with the family for a couple of weeks, and lots of games and playtesting ensued. We came up with some great variants which I'm going to be adding to the rules over the next couple of weeks.

The first variant: [Random Island Placement](/rules/#variant-random-island-placement)!

At the beginning of the game, each player takes it in turns to take a piece and place an island on any square they like with their token on it, *before* they look at the cards you've gained. This creates much more uniqueness for each game: especially when combined with some Advanced Sailing rules that we came up with that I'll reveal later. It also works brilliantly with [Treacherous Seas](/rules/#variant-treacherous-seas)....

See what you think! We noticed it added more randomness to the length of the games, and allowed more luck to creep in: how did you find it?
