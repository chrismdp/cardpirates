We've been working hard an iOS version of the game recently. We've switched away from MonkeyX to RubyMotion and have got the basics of the game in.

We currently have a hotseat version with movement, burying, drifting, card pickup and exchange and a captains log. We're working on finishing combat and getting in Game Center support so you can play easily with friends.

Here are some screenshost of the board and some of the panels:
