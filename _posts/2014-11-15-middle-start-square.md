I've been playing some same with my (now) 8yo daughter, and trialling some extra rules which work particularly well for Card Pirates 2.0. Here's the first:

## Middle start square

Leave the central square clear of cards at the start (one more in the draw pile), and place all the players in the middle.

If the players all start in the middle, it leaves a bunch of cards at the beginning for someone to collect later, it shows your intentions much more clearly right from the start and it prevents the luck of having a suited card from the island you start on.

What do you think?
