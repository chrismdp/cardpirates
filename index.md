# What is Card Pirates?

{% include ad-skyscraper.html %}

Card Pirates is a deep and thematic card game for 2 - 4 players. Players take the role of a old fashioned pirate ship on the high seas, searching for treasure, avoiding storms, attacking other ships and attempting to win the favour of the island governors.

It can be learned very quickly, and is great fun to play. You can win if you're lucky, but there's a high amount of strategy too.

The game is playable with **just one pack of playing cards and a token to represent each player.** We started with lego bricks and have moved on to little plastic ships from another game.

Try it with anyone aged about 6 years and older - my 7 and 9 year olds love it.

## The back story

I've always loved creating games with lots of theme and a story to tell with a bare minimum of materials.

I came up with the game one day whilst thinking about how to play test an online game I am currently prototyping.

I tried it that afternoon with my kids and they loved it, suggesting lots of ideas for improvement - especially after my 9 year old son chased my ship through storms, until he'd extracted the last ounce of treasure!

This is the first version of the rules. I'll be making more improvements as time goes on. The source code for this site is [available here](http://github.com/chrismdp/cardpirates) - do feel free to submit pull requests for modifications or improvements if that's your thing.

If you play it, [let me know!](/stories)
